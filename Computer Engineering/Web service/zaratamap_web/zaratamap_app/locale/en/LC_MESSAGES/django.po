msgid "Human hearing range is composed by all frequencies that can be discerned by humans. This range varies from person to person, and is shortened with age. As an abstract generalization, all frequencies between 20 and 20000 Hz are considered audible. However, two sounds with the same intensity (usually measured in dBs) are not perceived as loud if they have different frequencies, as human sensitivity to sound varies with frequency. This phenomena is studied using specialized graphs called Equal-loudness contours, that measure sound pressure (in dB SPL) over frequencies inside the hearing range, for which a person recognizes different pure tones to have a steady loudness. Consequently, all points in a Equal-loudness contour will have the same perception, called sonority, measured in phons, reference measurement unit in these analysis. The most popular curve is called A-weighting, internationally defined in the IEC 61672:2003 standard."

msgid "The essence of this project is to capture noise levels in a city in real time, obtaining much more data than the one gathered in the conventional method of generating noise maps. This currently used practice relies on public workers performing measurements with sonometers in predefined times and locations, limiting the noise representation of the city to those specifications. With the autonomous sonometer developed in this project, not only the number of data frames increases exponentially, but the variety of times and geo-positions they are made in do too."

This communication and storage scheme will provide  the  means for the  development  of  a GIS  technology,  mapping  noise  levels with GPS locations in a graphical outline."

msgid "The result will be a web service, that will provide different functionalities to the end user, having the graphical representation of data as the core behaviour. For  personalized representations, different filters will  be provided,  based on time frame (per day, week, month…), total noise level, octave or geographical localization of data. This feature will be expanded  into historical management of data and  specialized  report  generation,  with  the  ultimate objective  of  supporting  decision-making processes. Regarding the platform itself, it will maintain two user profiles, general public and private managers, providing expressly designed reports for both  of them. This functionality, coupled with an intuitive and multiplatform design of the  service, will transform  the accessibility of the  prevalent noise pollution information, under the umbrella of eco-friendly smart cities."
