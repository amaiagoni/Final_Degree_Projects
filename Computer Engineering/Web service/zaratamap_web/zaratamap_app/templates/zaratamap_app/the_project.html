These related values will be obtained using IIR filters in a microcontroller, that will associate them to a specific time stamp and GPS location. These data frames will be transmitted to a time-series focused database running in a remote central server for its storage, specifically designed for the project, via Wi-Fi connection. The final sonometer device will be encapsulated for its placement in designed means of transport and will be calibrated using a professional sonometer to ensure data accuracy.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

This currently used practice relies on public workers performing measurements with sonometers in predefined times and locations, limiting the noise representation of the city to those specifications. With the autonomous sonometer developed in this project, not only the number of data frames increases exponentially, but the variety of times and geo-positions they are made in do too.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

This communication and storage scheme will provide  the  means for the  development  of  a GIS  technology,  mapping  noise  levels with GPS locations in a graphical outline.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

For  personalized representations, different filters will  be provided,  based on time frame (per day, week, monthâ€¦), total noise level, octave or geographical localization of data. This feature will be expanded  into historical management of data and  specialized  report  generation,  with  the  ultimate objective  of  supporting  decision-making processes. Regarding the platform itself, it will maintain two user profiles, general public and private managers, providing expressly designed reports for both  of them. This functionality, coupled with an intuitive and multiplatform design of the  service, will transform  the accessibility of the  prevalent noise pollution information, under the umbrella of eco-friendly smart cities.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
